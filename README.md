# deloitte-data-analytics
The Deloitte Australia Data Analytics Virtual Internship Program, hosted on Forage, where I worked on a real-world business simulation to analyze operational telemetry data from Daikibo factories. The goal of this project was to identify and visualize patterns in system downtime across various factory locations and device types. Using Tableau, I cleaned and prepared the dataset, created a calculated field called Unhealthy to quantify downtime (10 minutes for each unhealthy status), and built multiple visualizations to reveal critical insights. I designed two bar charts: one showing down time per factory and the other showing down time per device type, and then combined them into an interactive dashboard that allows factory-level filtering. This experience allowed me to apply data cleaning techniques, perform visual analytics, and effectively communicate insights through dashboards ‚Äî essential skills in any data-driven environment. This project has strengthened my ability to turn raw data into actionable business intelligence using modern analytics tools. The repository includes the project dashboard screenshot, insights summary, and certificate of completion.
